## Objective
This     repository is to solve those frustrating test from huge companies.

This are some exercises I tried to solve in a very important code interview
sometimes I should to solve a problem in less of one hour,
but I'm a very nervous person in that challenges :sweat_smile: then I fail in time,
or I block myself trying to get the best code in time and performance and so...
but I just fight against frustration to not finish on time
I will start solve it one by one I will try to add a simple explanation about
every one of this games.:neckbeard:

P.S. I hate not handle time in code Interview.:confused:

## Maze :mouse2:
The idea of this game is buid a maze in a matrix n X m, here exist a goal to
touch inside the maze :icecream: in my case I chose my 'J' character by obvious
reasons :sun_with_face:.

Ok, the goal is clear, find the path to get the 'J', but what about the rules,
then this maze is n X m and have a goal in one of the box with value 'J',
also  a valid hall is a '0' and walls are '1', any other character is like a
wall.

:mouse: Ready for a simple explanation?

### Recursivity
Recursivity is an awesome property in programing languages,
the main idea is use the same method again and again cause ....
it call itself .
:rice_scene::shipit:

In this case is a little bit different, I use an object that create another
object like itself only with one difference, move one box in the matrix.

This solution evolve an understanding of variables by value and reference.
That is why the goal solutions are stored.

Probably I'm creating more doubts than solutions for you but if you have no idea
is actually good cause now you have a path to research.

## Lotery
Lotery is a game that give you numbers for lottery  :neutral_face:
Ok is not so fun, but In my defense I was trying to create an Alexa skill,
and in that moment I thought she.. or it, only read strigs and not numbers cause
In Mexico does not exist that skill, you know, you thing that if you are the first
is because some one else try it and couldnÂ´t.

Then I create a code that use regular expressions to translade numbers to
strings in Spanish ...

 :sweat_smile: I hope you not see it boring now.
