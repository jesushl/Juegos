## Objective
This     repository is to solve those frustrating test from huge companies.

This are some exercises I tried to solve in a very important code interview
sometimes I should to solve a problem in less of one hour,
but I'm a very nervous person in that challenges :sweat_smile: then I fail in time,
or I block myself trying to get the best code in time and performance and so...
but I just fight against frustration to not finish on time
I will start solve it one by one I will try to add a simple explanation about
every one of this games.:neckbeard:

P.S. I hate not handle time in code Interview.:confused:

### Maze :mouse2:
The idea of this game is buid a maze in a matrix n X m, here exist a goal to
touch inside the maze :icecream: in my case I chose my 'J' character by obvious
reasons :sun_with_face:.

Ok, the goal is clear, find the path to get the 'J', but what about the rules,
then this maze is n X m and have a goal in one of the box with value 'J',
also  a valid hall is a '0' and walls are '1', any other character is like a
wall.

:mouse: Ready for a simple explanation?
